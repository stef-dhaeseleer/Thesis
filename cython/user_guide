HOW TO CONNECT TO DEVICE

After preparing the SD card and putting it in the FPGA, connect the FPGA via USB to
to the UART port.

Open a terminal window on the PC.
Turn on the FPGA (it will now begin booting)
For Linux device: use the 'make uart' command (found in the make file) to connect.

username: root
password: noot

USING THE PLATFORM WHEN CONNECTED

Start location directory tree:

root
|-- cython
|	|
|	| python files
|
|-- reports
	|
	| key, param, status, results files

To set the parameters, edit (or create) the 'param.txt' file according to the template.

First cd to the cython directory
	cd cython

Then open Python and import the monitor file
	python
	import monitor

Now you can use all the functions form the monitor file to control the HW.

'monitor.help()' gives an overview of what all the functions do.

Normal workflow looks like this:
	
	monitor.init_platform()	
	monitor.performance_stats()

	monitor.get_hw_status()
	monitor.start_all(1)

	...
	
	monitor.get_hw_status()

	monitor.get_results_all()
	monitor.print_results()
	

Explanation:
init_platform(): Initialises the platform (creates the status and results file).
		 If the params file is present, it will list the current parameters.
		 Else the user will be prompted to input the parameters.

performance_stats(): Prints the performance stats for the current setup. This way we 
		     know how long the run will take to complete once we start it.

get_hw_status(): Prints the status of the blocks (first to check if all are IDLE).

start_all(1): Starts all blocks with base seed 1 (seed increments for following blocks)

... : Let time pass for HW to finish (see performance stats for duration).

get_hw_status(): Prints the status of the blocks to check if all are DONE. 

get_results_all(): Collects the counter results from all blocks that are done and writes
		   them into the results file.

print_results(): Prints the results file to the terminal so the user can see the results.

After this, the cycle can be repeated if needed (new seeds, new masks, new keys...).
