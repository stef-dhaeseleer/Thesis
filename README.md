# Thesis: Hardware design for cryptanalysis
## System
* Definition
We designed a custom hardware system to perform linear cryptanalytic experiments on DES. The design is made for the ZC102 Xilinx FPGA platform and can be controlled by the user from a host PC via an SD card containing a Linux OS on the FPGA.

* Reduced DES
A version with a reduced round implementation of DES is provided

* full DES
A version with a full implementation of DES is provided

## Writing

This contains a guide on how to use the system in the Appendix.
